1) Selectively activate an environment on a handful of hosts
/apollo/env/SDETools/bin/apolloEnvironmentControl --environmentFullName <environment, including stage> --host <host1> --host <host2>


2) Deactivate a local environment
/apollo/env/runCommand -e <environment> -a <activate/deactivate>


3) How to check-in changes?
- p4 change <clist #>

- p4 submit -c <clist #>
	- <description> <url to codereview> [cr: <reviewer>]

- brazilIntegrate --from mainline --to release --package <package name>
	- automatically trigger pipeline changes (see pipelines.amazon.com)

- go to build.amazon.com and build to live version set (IMPORTANT)


4) ssh2hc <HOSTCLASSNAME> - quickly ssh into one of the hosts in a hostclass

5) In BROWSE-TEST databases, we have two accounts: davidcgl_admin and davidcgl_ro
    - password needs to be wrapped in " " 

6) If copy/paste doesn't work, try VBoxClient --clipboard
